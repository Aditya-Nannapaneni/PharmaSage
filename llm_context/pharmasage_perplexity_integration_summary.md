# PharmaSage Perplexity API Integration - Comprehensive Summary

## Project Overview

PharmaSage is a comprehensive pharmaceutical business intelligence platform that provides real-time insights into global pharmaceutical trade flows, buyer discovery, and contact intelligence. The platform is built with a React frontend and FastAPI backend, with PostgreSQL for data storage.

## Integration Objective

The goal was to integrate the Perplexity API to enhance the buyer discovery capabilities of PharmaSage. The Perplexity API provides deep research capabilities that can identify potential buyers for pharmaceutical products by analyzing company websites and other data sources.

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Perplexity API Client (`backend/app/services/perplexity_client.py`)

We created a dedicated client for the Perplexity API with the following features:

- API key configuration via environment variables
- Error handling for API failures (rate limits, authentication errors, etc.)
- Response parsing to extract relevant information
- In-memory caching to reduce redundant API calls
- Mock implementation for testing without a real API key

Key functions:
- `run_deep_research(prompt, max_tokens)`: Executes a deep research query using the Perplexity API
- `run_deep_research_with_cache(prompt, max_tokens, cache_ttl_hours)`: Cached version of the above function

The client uses the Perplexity Chat Completions API endpoint (`https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions`) with the `sonar-medium-online` model.

### 2. Buyer Research Service (`backend/app/services/buyer_research.py`)

We implemented a service that uses the Perplexity API client to research potential buyers:

- Prompt template for buyer discovery
- Markdown parsing to extract structured data from research results
- Conversion of research results into prospect objects

Key functions:
- `format_prompt_with_company_data(company_website)`: Formats the research prompt with company data
- `extract_section_from_markdown(markdown, section_title)`: Extracts a specific section from markdown text
- `parse_markdown_table(table_text)`: Parses a markdown table into a list of dictionaries
- `parse_research_results(research_response)`: Parses the research results into a structured format
- `research_potential_buyers(db, company_name, company_website, products)`: Main function that orchestrates the research process

### 3. Research API Endpoint (`backend/app/api/research.py`)

We created a new API endpoint for direct access to the research functionality:

- POST `/api/research/buyers`: Researches potential buyers for a company
- GET `/api/research/status`: Checks the status of the research service

### 4. Enhanced Matching Service (`backend/app/services/matching.py`)

We updated the matching service to optionally use the Perplexity-powered research:

- Added `use_deep_research` parameter to the `find_prospects` function
- Enhanced the `get_prospect_details` function to handle research-based prospects
- Updated the `generate_outreach_guidance` function to provide customized guidance for research-based prospects

### 5. Updated Match API (`backend/app/api/match.py`)

We modified the match API to support the deep research functionality:

- Added `use_deep_research` and `company_website` parameters to the `/api/match/prospects` endpoint
- Updated parameter handling to correctly process these new parameters

### 6. Configuration Updates (`backend/app/core/config.py`)

We updated the configuration to include the Perplexity API key:

- Added `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` to the `Settings` class
- Updated the `.env.example` file to include the Perplexity API key

### 7. Unit Tests

We created comprehensive unit tests for the new components:

- `backend/tests/test_perplexity_client.py`: Tests for the Perplexity API client
- `backend/tests/test_buyer_research.py`: Tests for the buyer research service

## Implementation Details

### Perplexity API Client

The Perplexity API client is responsible for making requests to the Perplexity API and handling the responses. It includes error handling for various scenarios, such as rate limits and authentication errors. It also includes a caching mechanism to reduce redundant API calls.

```python
def run_deep_research(prompt: str, max_tokens: Optional[int] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Execute a deep research query using the Perplexity API.
    
    Args:
        prompt: The research prompt to send to Perplexity
        max_tokens: Optional maximum number of tokens for the response
        
    Returns:
        The JSON response from the Perplexity API
        
    Raises:
        Exception: If the API request fails
    """
    if not PERPLEXITY_API_KEY:
        logger.error("Perplexity API key not found in environment variables")
        raise Exception("Perplexity API key not configured. Please set the PERPLEXITY_API_KEY environment variable.")
    
    # Use mock response for testing
    if USE_MOCK_RESPONSES:
        logger.info("Using mock response for testing")
        return _get_mock_response(prompt)
    
    try:
        headers = {
            "Authorization": f"Bearer {PERPLEXITY_API_KEY}",
            "Content-Type": "application/json"
        }
        
        payload = {
            "model": "sonar-medium-online",
            "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
            "stream": False
        }
        
        if max_tokens:
            payload["max_tokens"] = max_tokens
        
        logger.info(f"Sending request to Perplexity API: {PERPLEXITY_API_URL}")
        response = requests.post(PERPLEXITY_API_URL, json=payload, headers=headers)
        response.raise_for_status()
        
        # Extract the text from the response
        api_response = response.json()
        text = api_response.get("choices", [{}])[0].get("message", {}).get("content", "")
        
        # Return in the format expected by the buyer_research module
        return {"text": text}
    
    except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as e:
        if e.response.status_code == 429:
            # Rate limit exceeded
            logger.warning("Perplexity API rate limit exceeded")
            raise Exception("Research service temporarily unavailable. Please try again later.")
        elif e.response.status_code == 401:
            # Authentication error
            logger.error("Perplexity API authentication failed")
            raise Exception("Research service configuration error. Please contact support.")
        else:
            logger.error(f"Perplexity API error: {str(e)}")
            raise Exception(f"Research service error: {str(e)}")
    
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Unexpected error in Perplexity client: {str(e)}")
        raise Exception("An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later.")
```

The caching mechanism uses a simple in-memory cache with a time-to-live (TTL) parameter:

```python
def run_deep_research_with_cache(
    prompt: str, 
    max_tokens: Optional[int] = None, 
    cache_ttl_hours: int = 24
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Execute a deep research query using the Perplexity API with caching.
    
    Args:
        prompt: The research prompt to send to Perplexity
        max_tokens: Optional maximum number of tokens for the response
        cache_ttl_hours: Time-to-live for cache entries in hours
        
    Returns:
        The JSON response from the Perplexity API
    """
    # Generate cache key from prompt and max_tokens
    cache_key = hashlib.md5(f"{prompt}:{max_tokens}".encode()).hexdigest()
    
    # Check cache
    now = datetime.now()
    if cache_key in _cache:
        cached_result, timestamp = _cache[cache_key]
        if now - timestamp < timedelta(hours=cache_ttl_hours):
            logger.info(f"Cache hit for key: {cache_key[:8]}...")
            return cached_result
    
    # Execute API call
    logger.info(f"Cache miss for key: {cache_key[:8]}...")
    result = run_deep_research(prompt, max_tokens)
    
    # Update cache
    _cache[cache_key] = (result, now)
    
    return result
```

### Buyer Research Service

The buyer research service uses the Perplexity API client to research potential buyers for a company. It formats a prompt with the company's website and sends it to the Perplexity API. It then parses the response to extract structured data about potential buyers.

```python
def research_potential_buyers(
    db: Session, 
    company_name: str, 
    company_website: str, 
    products: List[str]
) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    Research potential buyers for a company using AI-powered deep research.
    
    Args:
        db: Database session
        company_name: Name of the company
        company_website: Website URL of the company
        products: List of product names
        
    Returns:
        List of potential buyer prospects with details
    """
    try:
        logger.info(f"Researching potential buyers for {company_name} ({company_website})")
        
        # Format the prompt with the company data
        prompt = format_prompt_with_company_data(company_website)
        
        # Execute the research query with caching
        research_response = run_deep_research_with_cache(prompt)
        
        # Parse the research results
        prospects = parse_research_results(research_response)
        
        # Add unique IDs and additional metadata
        for i, prospect in enumerate(prospects):
            prospect["id"] = f"research-{i+1}"
            prospect["opportunityScore"] = 75  # Default score for research-based prospects
            prospect["status"] = "Research"
            prospect["source"] = "perplexity_research"
        
        logger.info(f"Found {len(prospects)} potential buyers through research")
        
        return prospects
    
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error researching potential buyers: {str(e)}")
        raise Exception(f"Failed to research potential buyers: {str(e)}")
```

The service includes functions for parsing the markdown response from the Perplexity API:

```python
def parse_research_results(research_response: Dict[str, Any]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    Parse the research results from the Perplexity API.
    
    Args:
        research_response: The response from the Perplexity API
        
    Returns:
        List of potential buyer prospects with details
    """
    try:
        # Extract the text from the response
        if "text" not in research_response:
            logger.error("Unexpected response format from Perplexity API")
            return []
        
        text = research_response["text"]
        
        # Extract the recommended targets table
        table_section = extract_section_from_markdown(text, "Recommended Target Companies Table")
        if not table_section:
            logger.error("Could not find recommended targets table in research results")
            return []
        
        # Parse the table
        table_data = parse_markdown_table(table_section)
        
        # Convert to prospect objects
        prospects = []
        for row in table_data:
            prospect = {
                "name": row.get("Company Name", ""),
                "website": row.get("Website", ""),
                "location": row.get("Country/Region", ""),
                "segment": row.get("Target Segment", ""),
                "keyContacts": [row.get("Key Contacts", "")] if row.get("Key Contacts") else [],
                "reasonForRecommendation": row.get("Reason for Recommendation", "")
            }
            prospects.append(prospect)
        
        return prospects
    
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error parsing research results: {str(e)}")
        return []
```

### Research API Endpoint

The research API endpoint provides direct access to the research functionality:

```python
@router.post("/buyers", response_model=List[Dict[str, Any]])
async def research_buyers(
    company_name: str = Body(..., description="Company name"),
    company_website: str = Body(..., description="Company website URL"),
    products: List[str] = Body(..., description="List of product names"),
    db: Session = Depends(get_db),

        company_name: Name of the company
        company_website: Website URL of the company
        products: List of product names
        db: Database session
        
    Returns:

    """
    try:
        return buyer_research.research_potential_buyers(

        )
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))
```

It also includes a status endpoint to check if the research service is properly configured:

```python
@router.get("/status", response_model=Dict[str, Any])
async def check_research_status() -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Check the status of the research service.
    
    This endpoint verifies that the research service is properly configured
    and available.
    
    Returns:

    """
    status = {
        "service": "research",
        "status": "available" if settings.PERPLEXITY_API_KEY else "unconfigured",
        "message": "Research service is ready" if settings.PERPLEXITY_API_KEY else "API key not configured"
    }
    
    return status
```

### Enhanced Matching Service

We updated the matching service to optionally use the Perplexity-powered research:

```python
def find_prospects(
    db: Session, 
    company_name: str, 
    products: List[str], 
    licensed_markets: List[str], 
    limit: int = 10,

        company_website: Website URL of the company (required if use_deep_research is True)
        
    Returns:

    """
    results = []
    
    # If deep research is requested and we have a company website
    if use_deep_research and company_website:
        try:
            # Import here to avoid circular imports
            from app.services import buyer_research
            
            logger.info(f"Using deep research for {company_name} ({company_website})")
            
            # Get research-based prospects
            research_results = buyer_research.research_potential_buyers(
                db, company_name, company_website, products

            # Debug log the research results
            logger.info(f"Research results: {research_results}")
            
            # Add research results to the list
            results.extend(research_results)
            
            logger.info(f"Found {len(research_results)} prospects through deep research")
            logger.info(f"Results after adding research: {len(results)} prospects")
        except Exception as e:
            # Log the error but continue with the regular matching
            logger.error(f"Deep research failed: {str(e)}")

    logger.info(f"Results after adding mock: {len(results)} prospects")
    
    # Sort by opportunity score (descending)
    results.sort(key=lambda x: x["opportunityScore"], reverse=True)
    
    # Limit the results
    limited_results = results[:limit]
    logger.info(f"Final results after limiting: {len(limited_results)} prospects")
    
    return limited_results
```

We also updated the `get_prospect_details` function to handle research-based prospects:

```python
def get_prospect_details(
    db: Session, 
    prospect_id: str
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Get detailed information about a prospect.

        logger.info("This is a research-based prospect")
        
        # For research-based prospects, we need to get the data from the research service
        try:

    # If prospect not found, return empty dict
    logger.warning(f"Prospect not found: {prospect_id}")
    return {}
```

And we updated the `generate_outreach_guidance` function to provide customized guidance for research-based prospects:

```python
def generate_outreach_guidance(
    db: Session, 
    prospect_id: str, 
    company_id: str,

### Updated Match API

We modified the match API to support the deep research functionality:

```python
@router.post("/prospects", response_model=List[Dict[str, Any]])
async def find_prospects(
    company_name: str = Body(..., description="Company name"),
    products: List[str] = Body(..., description="List of product names or IDs"),
    licensed_markets: List[str] = Body(..., description="List of licensed markets"),
    limit: int = Body(10, description="Maximum number of prospects to return"),
    use_deep_research: bool = Body(False, description="Whether to use AI-powered deep research"),
    company_website: Optional[str] = Body(None, description="Company website URL (required if use_deep_research is True)"),
    db: Session = Depends(get_db),
) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    Find potential buyer prospects.
    
    This endpoint analyzes the input company, products, and licensed markets
    to identify potential buyers across the supplied markets.
    
    Args:
        company_name: Name of the company
        products: List of product names or IDs
        licensed_markets: List of licensed markets
        limit: Maximum number of prospects to return
        use_deep_research: Whether to use AI-powered deep research
        company_website: Company website URL (required if use_deep_research is True)
        db: Database session
        
    Returns:
        List of potential buyer prospects with details
    """
    try:
        # Debug log the input parameters
        logger.info(f"API call: find_prospects with use_deep_research={use_deep_research}, company_website={company_website}")
        
        # Validate that company_website is provided if use_deep_research is True
        if use_deep_research and not company_website:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=400, 
                detail="Company website URL is required when using deep research"
            )
            
        # Call the service function
        results = matching_service.find_prospects(
            db, 
            company_name, 
            products, 
            licensed_markets, 
            limit,
            use_deep_research,
            company_website
        )
        
        # Debug log the results
        logger.info(f"API result: {len(results)} prospects")
        
        return results
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"API error: {str(e)}")
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))
```

### Configuration Updates

We updated the configuration to include the Perplexity API key:

```python
class Settings(BaseSettings):
    # ... other settings ...
    
    # Perplexity API settings
    PERPLEXITY_API_KEY: Optional[str] = None
    
    # ... other settings ...
```

### Unit Tests

We created comprehensive unit tests for the new components:

```python
class TestPerplexityClient(unittest.TestCase):
    """Test cases for the Perplexity API client."""

    @patch('app.services.perplexity_client.requests.post')
    @patch('app.services.perplexity_client.PERPLEXITY_API_KEY', 'test_api_key')
    @patch('app.services.perplexity_client.USE_MOCK_RESPONSES', False)
    def test_run_deep_research(self, mock_post):
        """Test the run_deep_research function."""
        # Mock the response from the Perplexity API
        mock_response = MagicMock()
        mock_response.json.return_value = {
            "choices": [{"message": {"content": "This is a test response from the Perplexity API."}}]
        }
        mock_post.return_value = mock_response

        # Call the function
        result = run_deep_research("Test prompt")

        # Check that the function called the API with the correct parameters
        mock_post.assert_called_once()
        args, kwargs = mock_post.call_args
        self.assertEqual(kwargs['json']['messages'][0]['content'], "Test prompt")
        self.assertEqual(kwargs['json']['model'], "sonar-medium-online")
        self.assertEqual(kwargs['headers']['Authorization'], "Bearer test_api_key")

        # Check that the function returned the expected result
        self.assertEqual(result, {"text": "This is a test response from the Perplexity API."})
```

```python
class TestBuyerResearch(unittest.TestCase):
    """Test cases for the buyer research service."""

    def test_format_prompt_with_company_data(self):
        """Test the format_prompt_with_company_data function."""
        # Mock the prompt template
        with patch('app.services.buyer_research.PROSPECT_IDENTIFICATION_PROMPT', 
                  'Test prompt with <source_company_url>'):
            # Call the function
            result = format_prompt_with_company_data('https://example.com')
            
            # Check that the function returned the expected result
            self.assertEqual(result, 'Test prompt with https://example.com')
```
